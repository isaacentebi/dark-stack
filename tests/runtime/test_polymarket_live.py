"""Polymarket orders on the live venue, through the running world.

Chapter II §II.b (physics is enforced): every order has a durable intent before the
network call and its hash in that intent, a lost answer is looked up and never resent, a
fill is booked once and never past its order, the pot never trades on principal above its
cap, and the pot's books reconcile ``claimed + unattributed == booked``. §III.b: a held
position's realized consequence is its resolution's payout, booked late into the pot. The
venue is ``LivePolymarket`` talking to ``FakeClob`` in process; nothing here touches a
network or a funded key.
