"""The polymarket pot against Polygon's own word (issue #180), through the running world.

Chapter II §II.b (physics is enforced): the pot's reconciliation held the books to
Polymarket's APIs, so an answer they gave wrong the same way everywhere was adopted.
Each test here makes the chain and the APIs disagree, or the chain go unread, and
asserts that buying waits or halts and nothing is paid that the chain does not state.
The venue is ``LivePolymarket`` on ``FakeClob``, whose fake chain answers from the
simulated venue's own state; nothing touches a network or a funded key.
