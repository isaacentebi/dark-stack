"""Polymarket orders on the live CLOB: signed V2 orders, their auth, and the pot's reads.

The venue is the world (AGENTS.md: a venue is not architecture). This module is the
seam between the runtime's order intents (``runtime/polymarket.py``) and Polymarket's
central limit order book on Polygon. It adds no decision: it builds, signs, sends and
reads back exactly the orders the runtime has already ledgered as intents, and it
reports what the venue says in the same shapes the simulated venue
(``world/polymarket.py``, ``FakePolymarket``) uses.

Protocol facts, each read 2026-09-29 (Polymarket moved to CLOB V2 on 2026-04-28):

* **Order struct and domain.** EIP-712 ``Order(uint256 salt,address maker,address
  signer,uint256 tokenId,uint256 makerAmount,uint256 takerAmount,uint8 side,uint8
  signatureType,uint256 timestamp,bytes32 metadata,bytes32 builder)`` under domain
  ``{name: "Polymarket CTF Exchange", version: "2", chainId: 137, verifyingContract}``;
  V2 dropped ``taker``, ``expiration``, ``nonce`` and ``feeRateBps`` from the signed
  struct (``expiration`` still travels unsigned in the body).
  https://docs.polymarket.com/v2-migration, https://docs.polymarket.com/trading/place-orders,
  https://github.com/Polymarket/ctf-exchange-v2 (``src/exchange/libraries/Structs.sol``,
  ``mixins/Hashing.sol``). The digest ``order_hash`` computes was checked against the
  exchange's own ``hashOrder`` by an ``eth_call`` on Polygon (``tests/world``).
* **Signature types.** 0 EOA, 1 POLY_PROXY, 2 POLY_GNOSIS_SAFE, 3 POLY_1271 (a Deposit
  Wallet, ERC-1271, the default for accounts made since 2026-05-04; an EOA trades only
  if Polymarket allowlisted it). For 3 the EOA signs an ERC-7739 ``TypedDataSign``
  wrapper. https://docs.polymarket.com/trading/wallets-auth,
  https://github.com/Polymarket/py-clob-client-v2 (``order_utils``).
* **Contracts (Polygon 137).** CTF Exchange ``0xE111180000d2663C0091e4f400237545B87B996B``,
  Neg Risk CTF Exchange ``0xe2222d279d744050d28e00520010520000310F59``, Conditional
  Tokens ``0x4D97DCd97eC945f40cF65F87097ACe5EA0476045``, pUSD (6 decimals)
  ``0xC011a7E12a19f7B1f670d46F03B03f3342E82DFB``, CtfCollateralAdapter
  ``0xAdA100Db00Ca00073811820692005400218FcE1f``, NegRiskCtfCollateralAdapter
  ``0xadA2005600Dec949baf300f4C6120000bDB6eAab``, CollateralOnramp
  ``0x93070a847efEf7F70739046A929D47a521F5B8ee``.
  https://docs.polymarket.com/resources/contracts, https://docs.polymarket.com/concepts/pusd
* **Amounts.** Collateral and outcome tokens both carry six decimals. A BUY's maker
  amount is ``price x size`` USD and its taker amount ``size`` tokens (a SELL the
  reverse; this venue signs BUYs only). Rounding per tick: ``polymarket.ROUNDING``
  (``amount_refusal``, the one amount rule of both venue kinds).
  https://docs.polymarket.com/trading/place-orders
* **Auth.** L1: EIP-712 ``ClobAuth(address address,string timestamp,uint256 nonce,string
  message)`` under ``{name: "ClobAuthDomain", version: "1", chainId: 137}``; ``GET
  /auth/derive-api-key`` or ``POST /auth/api-key`` answer ``{apiKey, secret,
  passphrase}``. L2: ``POLY_SIGNATURE`` is HMAC-SHA256 over ``timestamp + METHOD + path +
  body`` (the query is not signed), keyed by the base64url-decoded secret, encoded as
  padded urlsafe base64. https://docs.polymarket.com/getting-started/api
* **Tick and minimum.** Ticks 0.1, 0.01, 0.005, 0.0025, 0.001, 0.0001; an off-tick
  price is rejected, never rounded; a size below ``orderMinSize`` is rejected.
  https://docs.polymarket.com/market-data/market-details,
  https://docs.polymarket.com/resources/error-codes
* **Fees.** ``fee = shares x rate x (p (1 - p))^exponent``, set at match time; "Makers
  are never charged fees. Only takers pay fees." https://docs.polymarket.com/trading/fees
* **Post-only.** "If a post-only order would match immediately (cross the spread), it's
  rejected instead of executed. This guarantees you're always the maker, never the
  taker" (https://docs.polymarket.com/concepts/order-lifecycle); the CLOB answers
  ``invalid post-only order: order crosses book`` (resources/error-codes), and
  ``postOnly`` is "only supported for GTC and GTD orders" (api-spec/clob-openapi.yaml).
  Every order here is GTC and post-only, so it is never charged a fee.
* **Order types.** GTC and GTD rest; FOK and FAK do not.
  ``POST /order`` answers ``{success, errorMsg, orderID, status: live | matched |
  delayed | unmatched, makingAmount, takingAmount}``; ``DELETE /order {orderID}``
  answers ``{canceled, not_canceled}``. The CLOB has no client order id: an order's
  identity is its hash, and re-posting it is rejected as ``Duplicated``.
  https://docs.polymarket.com/trading/place-orders, https://docs.polymarket.com/trading/manage-orders
* **Fills and positions.** ``GET /data/order/{hash}`` (``status`` LIVE, MATCHED,
  CANCELED, CANCELED_MARKET_RESOLVED, INVALID; ``original_size``, ``size_matched``);
  ``GET /data/orders``; ``GET /data/trades`` (a trade is MATCHED, MINED, CONFIRMED,
  RETRYING or FAILED; pages end at ``next_cursor == "LTE="``);
  ``GET /balance-allowance``; the Data API's ``/positions``.
  https://docs.polymarket.com/concepts/order-lifecycle, https://docs.polymarket.com/api-spec/clob-openapi.yaml
* **Resolution and redemption.** UMA's optimistic oracle (a 2 h challenge window, days
  on a disputed vote); Gamma shows ``closed``, ``umaResolutionStatus: resolved`` and the
  payout in ``outcomePrices``. A holder redeems with ``redeemPositions(pUSD, 0x0,
  conditionId, [1, 2])`` on the collateral adapter, an on-chain transaction paid in POL.
  https://docs.polymarket.com/concepts/resolution, https://docs.polymarket.com/trading/positions/manage
* **The chain's own word (issue #180).** What the APIs say the pot holds and what a
  resolution pays are checked against Polygon (``world/polygon_ctf.py``): the funder's
  pUSD and outcome-token balances (``chain_account``, compared by the runtime's
  reconciliation) and each resolution's payout vector, on a token proven to be its
  condition's position (``_chain_payout``).
* **Rate limits.** ``POST /order`` 5,000 per 10 s, ``/data/orders`` and ``/data/trades``
  500, ``/balance-allowance`` 200; Gamma ``/markets`` 300.
