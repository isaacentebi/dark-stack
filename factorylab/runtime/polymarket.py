"""Polymarket event markets in a running world: tools, custody, intents, settlement.

A world that enables ``[polymarket]`` gets a surface, not a strategy: three reads
of the public market (search, one market's contract, one token's book), two
reads of its own pot (its positions, its open orders), and where the pot exists
two writes (a limit order and its cancellation): on the simulated venue, or signed
on Polymarket's live CLOB (``world/polymarket_clob.py``). Nothing here asks a seat
to use any of it, and no description says it would be good to (AGENTS.md: physics
is enforced, not announced).

Why the surface exists at all: the population already sells forecasts inside
the loop and is scored on them by Brier. An event market is the same kind of
claim priced by people outside the loop and settled by the world, so a position
there is a consequence the factory cannot grade for itself (essay II.III: the
realized-consequence signal "sits outside the factory's input entirely";
II.IV.a, Hanson's "vote on values, bet on beliefs").

What the kernel enforces, and where:

* **Outside text is jailed.** Market questions, descriptions, slugs and
  resolution sources are written by third parties. A round that read them runs
  population tools only (``ComputeMixin.OUTSIDE_TEXT_TOOLS``), and every prose
  field long enough to be text is kept off durable surfaces exactly as a fetched
  connector body is (``protect``).
* **Writes are intents first.** Every order and cancellation has a client id
  (``<handle>:<slot>``) and a durable ``polymarket.intent`` before the venue is
  called; a repeat reconciles and never resubmits; an unanswered intent is
  polled on the venue's bounded schedule and then released as unknown.
* **Custody is separate.** Collateral is the ``polymarket`` pot. Its own balance
  and holds are the only collateral an order is weighed against; it never
  borrows the Hyperliquid accounts or the Base reserve.
* **The market's price settles early; its resolution settles late.** Fills enter
  the consequence book as ``event`` lots (``settlement/lots.py``), marked each
  tick at the midpoint of the token's book (``mark``). At the consequence
  backstop a held position is scored at that mark, exactly as an open spot lot
  is: the price is the
  market's anticipatory settlement of the belief, the cure the essay names for
  learning death (II.IV.b: "the compensation period of any exploratory learner
  must be shorter than the lifetime of the things it is being compensated for
  discovering"). The resolution closes the lot later (``LotTable.redeem``) and
  its money reaches the owner through ``_settle_late``; the score is never
  revised. A token with no two-sided book is not marked, and its decision falls back
  on its provisional verdict like any other unobserved consequence.
* **Claims stay in their custody.** What a Polymarket position realises is a
  claim on the polymarket pot (``claim_share``), never on the venue, and
  financing converts only venue claims, so a profit made on Polygon is never
  withdrawn from Hyperliquid money. The pot reconciles against its own books
  every tick (``reconcile``).
* **The world settles claims on its markets.** An enabled block, on either venue,
  offers the forecast predicates ``event_pays`` and ``event_price_above``
  (``settlement/vocabulary.py``). A claim is settled on this surface's own read of
  the named token at its due tick (``event_facts``): the market's resolution or its
  midpoint, a fact the world measures, never another model's reading (essay
  II.III.b). An unanswered read is an excluded sample, never a zero.
* **Third-party labels are not ours to repeat.** Outcome names are written by
  market creators. Every surface outside the jailed reads (the pot, custody, the
  pots, receipts, outcomes, the ledger) carries token and market ids and a
  normalised outcome (``YES``, ``NO`` or ``outcome <n>``), never the label.

def open_limit(spec: Any) -> int:

    An open read is a seat's claim to kernel reads: the settlement of its forecasts
    on one token due at one tick (``<registration>|due:<token>:<tick>``). Each seat
    registration holds its own, whether or not another seat holds the same token and
    tick, and at most ``seat_open_share`` of them (``open_claim``). One stays open
    while its forecasts are pending, and for one window (10 s of wall time) after the
    kernel's last request for it (``_read_for``). A seat holds open reads only through
    a venue read slot, and a freed slot is given again only once nothing its last
    holder held still counts (``reader_counts``).

    **Wall time.** Polymarket counts its limits in wall time, so every window here is
    wall time (``wall_now``): the live reader stamps each request with
    ``time.time_ns()`` just before it sends it, so a request counts from that stamp
    on, in flight or failed (``PolymarketReader.drain_sends``), the stamps
    are journaled, so a replay charges what the run charged, and a seat's admission
    and an open read's countdown are read against the same clock, never the world's.
    A live reader runs only on the wall clock (``arm``). A world's ticks can take any
    wall time, long or short, and the bound below never refers to them.

    **What reaches Polymarket.** A live world's public reads (the seats' and the
    kernel's settlement reads) are bounded here. A live world with orders
    (``orders = true``) also sends the pot's own requests (orders, cancels, lookups,
    fills, its account, held tokens' marks and a write's market read): they are
    counted by the pot's own budget, ``order_requests_per_10s`` in any sliding 10 s of
    wall time, each before it is sent (``LivePolymarket.budget``), never stamped as a
    public read, and the manifest holds ``read_requests_per_10s +
    order_requests_per_10s`` within the 300 Gamma ``/markets`` publishes. So the
    kernel's public requests are its settlement reads alone.

    **Open reads.** At any wall instant ``t`` at most ``max_readers ×
    seat_open_share <= N`` open reads count (admitted at or before ``t``, and still
    open or counting until after ``t``). A registration opens one only while fewer
    than its share count at that instant, and every other of its open reads counting
    at ``t`` was counting then too (still open, or its pass already run and its
    countdown final and past ``t``), so a registration holds at most its share. One
    registration a slot at a time: a slot goes to the next only once none of its
    last holder's open reads counts, so no instant holds both.

    **Kernel.** Every request the kernel sends is a settlement read (``event_facts``):
    the token's market by id, then its book for a price claim on an open market, at
    most ``KERNEL_READS_PER_OPEN`` = 2 for a token in a pass, sent in the one pass
    that settles that due tick (every forecast due at a tick is settled in the first
    pass at or after it, and none is ever deferred). Take any window ``(t - 10 s, t]``
    of wall time. A request stamped ``s`` in it leaves every open read that holds its
    settlement counting until at least ``s + 10 s > t``, and each was admitted before
    its pass, so every settlement the kernel read for in the window is held by an open
    read counting at ``t``: at most N of them, 2 requests each. The kernel sends at
    most ``2 N <= kernel_reserve_per_10s`` requests in any 10 s of wall time.

    **Seats.** A seat's read (and a claim's token lookup, 3 requests at its most) is
    admitted at wall time ``a`` only if the requests charged to its registration in
    ``(a - 10 s, a]`` leave room for it, and it is charged, at least what it sent, at
    the stamp of the last request it sent: not before ``a`` and not after the
    registration's next admission. Take the last of its reads with a request in a
    window ``(t - 10 s, t]``, admitted at ``a <= t``: every earlier read with a request
    in the window is charged in ``(t - 10 s, a]``, inside ``(a - 10 s, a]``, so all of
    them fit the share. A slot goes to the next registration only once its last
    holder's last charge is 10 s old. The seats send at most ``max_readers × share <=
    read_requests_per_10s - kernel_reserve_per_10s`` in any 10 s of wall time.

    **Worst case.** With the defaults (200 per 10 s, 100 of them the kernel's),
    N = 100 // 2 = 50; each of 16 slots holds up to 3 open reads and sends up to
    (200 - 100) // 16 = 6 requests per 10 s, one return's two claim lookups. In any
    10 s of wall time the kernel sends at most 2 × 50 = 100 and the seats at most
    16 × 6 = 96: 196 of the 300 Polymarket publishes for ``/markets``, its tightest
    limit. These counts are of stamps; Polymarket counts a request when it arrives,
    after its stamp. The 104 left cover only what the world cannot see: the difference
    between this host's clock and Polymarket's, and a request's time in flight from its
    stamp to its arrival. One live
    Polymarket world runs a host (``ip_lock``).
